The Nissan Z-car is a sports car which has been manufactured by Nissan Motors Ltd, in six generations, since 1969.
The original Z was sold from October 1969 in Japan, as the Nissan Fairlady Z, at Nissan Exhibition dealerships that previously sold the Nissan Bluebird. It was exported as the Datsun 240 Z. Since 2009 Nissan has manufactured the newest Z, the Nissan 370 Z.
Z accelerates so quickly. Have you already tried? It is simply amazing. I cannot believe that it has almost same engine to me.
The earlier models of the Nissan Z were built at the Nissan shatai plant in hyra tsuka, until 2000, while the later models are built at Oppama from 2002 to 2004, and at Totchigy since 2004 until now.
Mr. Ghosn, who was a former president of Nissan, owned Z 32 before and revived it as a lineup!
